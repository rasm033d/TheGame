Documenting some changes; subnettingcode.py is a ipv4 address generator, nothing speical so far.

#23-10-2019
Changed some extensions, updated some files, the broadcast subnet game is finished, as in, it generates a random IP and subnet mask, and can check to see if the player input is the broadcast; it also wont crash if characters, negative numbers are used. Added the core "game", the rooms, the mode of transporting the player from room to room. Visual representation is still needed.
