Documenting some changes; subnettingcode.py is a ipv4 address generator, nothing speical so far.

#23-10-2019
Changed some extensions, updated some files, the broadcast subnet game is finished, as in, it generates a random IP and subnet mask, and can check to see if the player input is the broadcast; it also wont crash if characters, negative numbers are used. Added the core "game", the rooms, the mode of transporting the player from room to room. Visual representation is still needed.

#28-10-2019
The big day! More or less a complete redesign of the "game", found out what the final game should be, added them to the main game. This is now playable!
Still need to fix input bug though, but that's easy enough!
